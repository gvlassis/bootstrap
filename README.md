# bootstrap

## Description

Program for fast bootstrapping of my personal development environment on new computers (e.g in the Cloud). The program does the following:

1. Checks the architecture of the new computer (macOS-arm64 and Linux-amd64 are supported)
1. Checks if the dependencies bzip2 and unzip are in PATH
1. Creates useful directories (e.g. $HOME/Projects)
1. Installs the *latest* versions of my essential programs. For those that do not offer prebuilt binaries, I use binaries compiled by me and hosted on my personal Google Drive
1. Sets up **bidirectional syncing of my configuration files via Google Drive**. This is similar to how Android backups certain settings on Google Drive.
1. Connects to my [Atuin](https://github.com/atuinsh/atuin) account
1. Writes my crontab
